                <p>Welcome to our project on the topic of “Social Media”, and our website on it<br>
                    Through our video we had watched, we will be talking about the few known figures and events<br>
                   mentioned, a bit of social media itself and how it is utilizes.  </p>

                    He used to work with others at Silicon Valley, and he had sold a company of his to Google, of all<br>
                    companies (Channel 4, 5:17). He used to have hopes for social media with people “doing good with it” 
                    (Channel 4, 16:21) , but it changed when he saw what it resulted into now (Channel 4, 5:32).
                    We found that his experience and opinions on social media are good.<br> <br>We can agree the explanations and
                    reasons he gave for the want for the change of its focus and functionalities because we’ve seen with the elections
                    and Trump, how theses apps have changed some people through addiction, and how their algorithm questionably dissect our data.</p>

    As we know, he is the creator of “Facebook”, and as recently with his new metaverse, “Meta”.
    While he has made one of the most well-known platforms which a lot of people use to communicate
    or promote their businesses and ideas. While there is good, it could be said that there are the bad 
    apples and toxic communities that gather in the corner of the website, and that they might have questionable
    or extreme views, and occasionally if they decide to get together somewhere for a gathering, things could go astray.<br><br>
    While ago there was the issue of him selling the data of the users to third parties, which sparked an outage and 
    the urgency that we should value our data. As mentioned by Jaron, even if Mark could “just change” the design philosophy of “Facebook”,
    it wouldn’t work out well because the “business incentives” for Mark and investors would go against the “consumers” of Facebook (Channel 4, 6:03-7:08).</p>

        The previous president of the U.S., Donald Trump, or the “funny orange man” as we tend to call him.
        In our case, we can remember how he would often boast about his actions and plans over on Twitter,
        and how people would respond to those tweets, good and bad, therefore giving him “excitement” over how
        people are talking about him.<br> <br>As himself a user and said by Jaron, Trump became a victim to the addiction
        that social media has on people. Jaron even pities him because as he recalls, Trump seemed to be a man “focused” on the prize,
        but through his venue of Twitter, he never seemed as “insecure” until he started touching it (Channel 4, 13:48-15:21).</p>

    <div class="content">
        <img src="../extra/data.jpeg" alt="Nature" style="width: 50%;"><p> When you browse the internet or have devices that could link to the internet, those devices will make “data” as you use them.
            Data is good as it can used to curate stuff for you based on your preferences and ideals, it is a positive as much a negative.
            A neat thing that some apps do now is that they’ll ask you how much data you want taken from you, whether it is for services or diagnostics.
            But more prominently in recent times, big corporations and third-party companies have been profiting from selling the data of users, 
            which is a sensitive topic because they are basically selling “us” through clever manipulation (Channel 4, 15:44).<br>
            <br>Data is then brought through algorithms which feeds on it in which you accumulated for it. A decent bit ago,
            there was the controversy with the “U.S. elections and Cambridge Analytica”, where data as well as the platforms were manipulated 
            to make Trump win the elections (Channel 4, 7:22-8:16). While the data itself was manipulated, there were many people on various platforms that<br>
            we’re pitted against others with opposing views, which created dispute and likely curved the elections through biased views. <br>
            The manipulation of data can happen regardless of platform, if there is access to data, then there’s access to it.</p>

                        There are various social media apps that we have come to known that allow us to interact with others.
                        We know a bunch of them, like “Twitter”, “Facebook”, “Instagram”, and there’s many others.
                        Interacting with others across the internet has become much more important now with the COVID pandemic.<br>
                        But alas, they have the potential to get addicted to, and these social apps services are typically ran by big
                        corporation and they profit from that addiction with the valuable data that is obtained through your interactions with their
                        services via the app. Despite its fallacies, it still has a chance to become good, 
                        <br>but it will need an overhaul with a more consumer-friendly use in mind (Channel 4, 5:29).</p>

                                    These are automated systems that feed on the content and data that users look at and create, basically an AI observing you.
                                    It looks for your patterns, how you behave on given platforms. Through the regurgitation of the results, it will try to veer you into 
                                    path with people with similar views and ideals, essentially an echo-chamber for people just like you. <br><br> As Jaron says, 
                                    there’s no way for you to “directly communicate” with it and even if you do catch onto it, it’s subtle enough.
                                    And it always looks for the “frequency” in which you react with the interface, rather “accumulatively” (Channel 4, 10:03-12:55). 
                                    The algorithms we’ve seen work are ones could by targeting a piece of content and moderating it but is somewhat ambiguous at times.
                                    An example I can make is the “YouTube” algorithm, how it looks at videos you look at and how it tries to bring similar videos for you to watch. 
                                    Another would be for Joseph Boumerhi, he looked for a web editor, like “Figma”, to work for the proposal of this website,
                                    and he begun get ads for “Figma” and the like, or more self-help videos after watching one.</p>
